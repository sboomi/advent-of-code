    "\n",
    "On the way to your [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a [\"1202 program alarm\"](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html#1023832). On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: _\"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\"_ The ship computer [bursts into flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire).\n",
    "\n",
    "You notify the Elves that the computer's [magic smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) seems to have escaped. _\"That computer ran **Intcode** programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "An Intcode program is a list of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an **opcode** - either **1, 2, or 99**. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, **99** means that the program is finished and should immediately *halt*. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opcode 1** *adds* together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values\n",
    "2. the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your Intcode computer encounters `1,10,20,30`, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opcode 2** works exactly like opcode 1, except it *multiplies* the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",

    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four integers, `1,9,10,3`, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,70,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "3500,9,10,70,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1,0,0,0,99` becomes `2,0,0,0,99` $(1 + 1 = 2)$.\n",
    "* `2,3,0,3,99` becomes `2,3,0,6,99` $(3 \\times 2 = 6)$.\n",
    "* `2,4,4,5,99,0` becomes `2,4,4,5,99,9801` $(99 \\times 99 = 9801)$.\n",
    "* `1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99` becomes `30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, **before running the program**, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. **What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?**\n",

    "The Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) starts by running a **diagnostic program** (your puzzle input). The TEST diagnostic program will run on your existing Intcode computer after a few modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "_First_, you'll need to add two new instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opcode 3 takes a single integer as **input** and saves it to the position given by its only parameter. For example, the instruction `3,50` would take an input value and store it at address 50.\n",
    "* Opcode 4 **outputs** the value of its only parameter. For example, the instruction `4,50` would output the value at address 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs that use these instructions will come with documentation that explains what should be connected to the input and output. The program 3,0,4,0,99 outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Second_, you'll need to add support for **parameter modes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. Right now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode 0, **position mode**, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory. Until now, all parameters have been in position mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, **immediate mode**. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. The opcode is a two-digit number based only on the ones and tens digit of the value, that is, the opcode is the rightmost two digits of the first value in an instruction. Parameter modes are **single digits**, one per parameter, read right-to-left from the opcode: the first parameter's mode is in the hundreds digit, the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on. Any missing modes are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the program `1002,4,3,4,33`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first instruction, `1002,4,3,4`, is a multiply instruction - the rightmost two digits of the first value, 02, indicate opcode 2, multiplication. Then, going right to left, the parameter modes are 0 (hundreds digit), 1 (thousands digit), and 0 (ten-thousands digit, not present and therefore zero):\n",

The second parameter, 3 in immediate mode, simply has value 3. The result of this operation, 33 * 3 = 99, is written according to the third parameter, 4 in position mode, which also works like it did before - 99 is written to address 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* It is important to remember that the instruction pointer should increase by the number of values in the instruction after the instruction finishes. Because of the new instructions, this amount is no longer always 4.\n",
    "* Integers can be negative: 1101,100,-1,4,0 is a valid program (find 100 + -1, store the result in position 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to test by running an input instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, like parameter modes, function correctly. For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating how far the result of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful. Non-zero outputs mean that a function is not working correctly; check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the program will output a **diagnostic code** and immediately halt. This final output isn't an error; an output followed immediately by a halt means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the diagnostic program ran successfully.\n",

    "Except for the universal Center of Mass (COM), every object in space is in orbit around exactly one other object. An [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit) looks roughly like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Before you use your map data to plot a course, you need to make sure it wasn't corrupted during the download. To verify maps, the Universal Orbit Map facility uses **orbit count checksums** - the total number of direct orbits (like the one shown above) and **indirect orbits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever A orbits B and B orbits C, then **A indirectly orbits C**. This chain can be any number of objects long: if A orbits B, B orbits C, and C orbits D, then **A indirectly orbits D**.\n",

    "<p>The Elves have sent you some <em>Amplifier Controller Software</em> (your puzzle input), a program that should run on your <a href=\"5\">existing Intcode computer</a>. Each amplifier will need to run a copy of the program.</p>\n",
    "<p>When a copy of the program starts running on an amplifier, it will first use an input instruction to ask the amplifier for its current <em>phase setting</em> (an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code>). Each phase setting is used <em>exactly once</em>, but the Elves can't remember which amplifier needs which phase setting.</p>\n",
    "<p>The program will then call another input instruction to get the amplifier's input signal, compute the correct output signal, and supply it back to the amplifier with an output instruction. (If the amplifier has not yet received an input signal, it waits until one arrives.)</p>\n",
    "<p>Your job is to <em>find the largest output signal that can be sent to the thrusters</em> by trying every possible combination of phase settings on the amplifiers. Make sure that memory is not shared or reused between copies of the program.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, suppose you want to try the phase setting sequence <code>3,1,2,4,0</code>, which would mean setting amplifier <code>A</code> to phase setting <code>3</code>, amplifier <code>B</code> to setting <code>1</code>, <code>C</code> to <code>2</code>, <code>D</code> to <code>4</code>, and <code>E</code> to <code>0</code>. Then, you could determine the output signal that gets sent from amplifier <code>E</code> to the thrusters with the following steps:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Start the copy of the amplifier controller software that will run on amplifier <code>A</code>. At its first input instruction, provide it the amplifier's phase setting, <code>3</code>.  At its second input instruction, provide it the input signal, <code>0</code>.  After some calculations, it will use an output instruction to indicate the amplifier's output signal.</li>\n",
    "<li>Start the software for amplifier <code>B</code>. Provide it the phase setting (<code>1</code>) and then whatever output signal was produced from amplifier <code>A</code>. It will then produce a new output signal destined for amplifier <code>C</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Start the software for amplifier <code>C</code>, provide the phase setting (<code>2</code>) and the value from amplifier <code>B</code>, then collect its output signal.</li>\n",
    "<li>Run amplifier <code>D</code>'s software, provide the phase setting (<code>4</code>) and input value, and collect its output signal.</li>\n",
    "<li>Run amplifier <code>E</code>'s software, provide the phase setting (<code>0</code>) and input value, and collect its output signal.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>The final output signal from amplifier <code>E</code> would be sent to the thrusters. However, this phase setting sequence may not have been the best one; another sequence might have sent a higher signal to the thrusters.</p>\n",
    "<p>Here are some example programs:</p>\n",
